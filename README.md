# RL-Language packs
A template Resourcepack for RLCraft translators.  
This template contains lang files and lang keys (English) for all texts displayed in RLCraft 2.10 and above.  

### If you already have a one-size-fits-all translation Resourcepack:
- RLCraft overrides many of the mod's original texts, so they fit better into the pack
- RLCraft also create some new lang keys using scripts
- Localizator creates a ton of new lang keys for previously hardcoded texts

Therefore, I suggest checking all the lang files included here, so players get the best experience possible.

### If you want to go above and beyond:
The "Sources" folder may be of help!  
It contains:
- A template GIMP file for your Resourcepack logo
- Empty sound and texture files to translate Lycanites events


### Note:
I'm not part of the RLCraft dev team, therefore a couple of texts may be missing.  
If you find any, please make a PR with screenshots, so I can include (or even create) those lang keys!

#### Note 2:
The poem books inside Recurrent complex structures are not worth making translatable.  
Please don't report those.  
It's too complex to do, would end up creating millions of lang keys and nobody reads them anyway.
