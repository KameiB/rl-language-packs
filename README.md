# RL-Language packs
A template Resource pack (English_RLC folder) for RLCraft translators.  
This template contains lang files and lang keys (English) for all texts displayed in RLCraft 2.10 and above.  

Clone this repository, translate and customize the pack.meta and pack.png files.  

Check the [Language Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language) to find your language code.  
When you finished translating:  
- Rename the "English_RLC" folder to match your language
- ZIP it
- Publish it to [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/), so RLCraft players can easily find it and download it.
- You can take my [Spanish Resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/espanol-para-rlcraft) as an example on how your page would look like.

### If you already have a one-size-fits-all translation Resource pack:
- RLCraft overrides many of the mod's original texts, so they fit better into the pack
- RLCraft also creates some new lang keys using scripts
- [Localizator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/localizator) creates a ton of new lang keys for previously hardcoded texts

Therefore, I suggest opening each lang file and execute a Contents Compare against your files, so players get the best experience possible.

### If you want to go above and beyond:
The "Sources" folder may be of help!  
It contains:
- A template GIMP file for your Resourcepack logo
- Empty sound and texture files to translate Lycanites events


### Note:
I'm not part of the RLCraft dev team, therefore a couple of texts may be missing.  
If you find any, please make a PR with screenshots, so I can include (or even create) those lang keys!

#### Note 2:
The poem books inside Recurrent complex structures are not worth making translatable.  
Please don't report those.  
It's too complex to do, would end up creating millions of lang keys and nobody reads them anyway.
