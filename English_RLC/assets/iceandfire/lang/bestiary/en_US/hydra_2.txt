The hydra fang is a valuable item that
can be used to craft special arrows
which poison their targets.

These arrows also have a second
important property: when they strike
the target, they leech life from them
and heal the shooter of the arrow.






The hydra heart is a rare drop of
the beast that is widely sought
after for its regenerative
properties.

The powerful heart of this
monster makes the difficult
battle well worth it, and
perhaps explains why the
Hydra's lair contains so
many bones.
