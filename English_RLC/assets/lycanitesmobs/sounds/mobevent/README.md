If you want to dub the mob event audios, check Lycanites [repository](https://gitlab.com/Lycanite/LycanitesMobs/-/tree/Minecraft-1.12.2/src/main/resources/assets/lycanitesmobs/sounds/mobevent?ref_type=heads),  
or the files inside LycanitesMobs JAR, located in:  
``/assets/lycanitesmobs/sounds/mobevent/``  
I used an AI tool to remove the vocals, so I could record my voice on them.  
The audios with no voice are located inside:  
``Sources/assets/lycanitesmobs/sounds/mobevent``  
- Listen to the original ones,
- Record your own audios  
- Use an editor to place your vocals over the non-vocal audios
- Save them as WAV and use a converter, or directly to OGG if you have the required software.
- Remember, files must be .ogg and with the best quality!
- Finally, save them in their corresponding place inside your respack.

I used this [site](https://convertio.co/wav-ogg/) to properly convert my recordings.
