If you want to dub the Halloween treat and Winter gift audios, check Lycanites [repository](https://gitlab.com/Lycanite/LycanitesMobs/-/tree/Minecraft-1.12.2/src/main/resources/assets/lycanitesmobs/sounds/item?ref_type=heads),  
or the files inside LycanitesMobs JAR, located in:  
/assets/lycanitesmobs/sounds/item/
- Listen to the original ones,
- Record your own audios  
- Save them with the exact same name as the ones you're overriding.  
- Remember, files must be .ogg and with the best quality!  
I used this [site](https://convertio.co/wav-ogg/) to properly convert my recordings.
